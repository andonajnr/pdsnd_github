### Project Title
bikeshare project

### Description
This project uses Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

Code was written to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.

It also includes a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

Try this out, it promises to be interactive and interesting.

Thanks.
